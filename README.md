`ggshield` is a CLI application that runs in your local environment or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 350+ types of secrets, as well as other potential security vulnerabilities or policy breaks affecting your codebase.

`ggshield` uses our [public API](https://api.gitguardian.com/doc) through [py-gitguardian](https://github.com/GitGuardian/py-gitguardian) to scan and detect potential vulnerabilities in files and other text content.

Only metadata such as call time, request size and scan mode is stored from scans using `ggshield`, therefore secrets and policy breaks incidents will not be displayed on your dashboard and **your files and secrets won't be stored**.

# Installation

## macOS - Using Homebrew

You can install `ggshield` using Homebrew by running the following command:

```shell
$ brew install gitguardian/tap/ggshield
```

## Linux packages

Deb and RPM packages are available on [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~gitguardian/repos/ggshield/packages/).

Setup instructions:

- [Deb packages](https://cloudsmith.io/~gitguardian/repos/ggshield/setup/#formats-deb)
- [RPM packages](https://cloudsmith.io/~gitguardian/repos/ggshield/setup/#formats-rpm)

## Other Operating Systems - Using pip

### Installing

```shell
$ pip install ggshield
```

`ggshield` supports **Python 3.7 and newer**.

The package should run on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

### Updating

To update `ggshield` you can add the option `-U/--upgrade` to the pip install command.

```shell
$ pip install -U ggshield
```

# Initial setup

To use `ggshield` you need to authenticate against GitGuardian servers. To do so, use the `ggshield auth login` command. This command automates the provisioning of a personal access token and its configuration on the local workstation.

You can learn more about it from [`ggshield auth login` documentation](https://docs.gitguardian.com/internal-repositories-monitoring/ggshield/reference/auth/login).

Alternatively, you can create your personal access token manually and you can store it in the `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` environment variable to complete the setup.

# Getting started

## Secrets

You can now use `ggshield` to search for secrets:

- in files: `ggshield secret scan path -r .`
- in repositories: `ggshield secret scan repo .`
- in Docker images: `ggshield secret scan docker ubuntu:22.04`
- in Pypi packages: `ggshield secret scan pypi flask`
- and more, have a look at `ggshield secret scan --help` output for details.

## Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

You can also search for vulnerabilities in your IaC files using the following command:

```
ggshield iac scan all .
```

However, if you are only interested in _new_ potential IaC vulnerabilities, you can run:

```
ggshield iac scan diff --ref=HEAD~1 .
```

Have a look at `ggshield iac scan --help` for more details.

# Integrations

You can integrate `ggshield` in your [CI/CD workflow](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/integrations/overview#cicd-integrations-secrets-detection-in-your-cicd-workflow).

To catch errors earlier, use `ggshield` as a [pre-commit, pre-push or pre-receive Git hook](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/integrations/overview#git-hooks-prevent-secrets-from-reaching-your-vcs).

# Learn more

For more information, have a look at [the documentation](https://docs.gitguardian.com/ggshield-docs/getting-started)

# Output

If no secrets or policy breaks have been found, the exit code will be 0:

```bash
$ ggshield secret scan pre-commit
```

If a secret or other issue is found in your staged code or in your CI, you will have an alert giving you the type of policy break, the filename where the policy break has been found and a patch giving you the position of the policy break in the file:

```shell
$ ggshield secret scan pre-commit

🛡️  ⚔️  🛡️  2 policy breaks have been found in file production.rb

11 | config.paperclip_defaults = {
12 |     :s3_credentials => {
13 |     :bucket => "XXX",
14 |     :access_key_id => "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
                            |_____AWS Keys_____|

15 |     :secret_access_key => "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
                                |_______________AWS Keys_______________|

16 |     }
17 | }
```

Lines that are too long are truncated to match the size of the terminal, unless the verbose mode is used (`-v` or `--verbose`).
