The **GitGuardian shield** (gg-shield) is a CLI application that runs in your local environment
or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 200 types of secrets, as well as other potential security vulnerabilities or policy breaks.

**GitGuardian shield** uses our [public API](https://api.gitguardian.com/doc) through [py-gitguardian](https://github.com/GitGuardian/py-gitguardian) to scan your files and detect potential secrets or issues in your code. **The `/v1/scan` endpoint of the [public API](https://api.gitguardian.com/doc) is stateless. We will not store any files you are sending or any secrets we have detected**.

You can also use gg-shield via the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework on your repositories, or as a standalone pre-commit either globally or locally.

You'll need an **API Key** from [GitGuardian](https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/api/v1/auth/user/github_login/authorize?utm_source=github&utm_medium=gg_shield&utm_campaign=shield1) to use gg-shield.

Add the API Key to your environment variables:

```shell
GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY=<GitGuardian API Key>
```

# Installation

Install and update using `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install ggshield
```

gg-shield supports **Python 3.6 and newer**.

The package should run on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

You'll need an **API Key** from the [GitGuardian dashboard](https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/api/v1/auth/user/github_login/authorize?utm_source=github&utm_medium=gg_shield&utm_campaign=shield1) to use ggshield.

Add the API Key to your environment variables:

```shell
GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY=<GitGuardian API Key>
```

# Commands

```shell
Usage: ggshield [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -c, --config-path FILE  Set a custom config file. Ignores local and global
                          config files.

  -v, --verbose           Verbose display mode.
  -h, --help              Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  install  Command to install a pre-commit hook (local or global).
  scan     Command to scan various contents.
```

## Scan command

`ggshield scan` is the main command for **gg-shield**, it has a few config
options that can be used to override output behaviour.

```shell
Usage: ggshield scan [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command to scan various contents.

Options:
  --show-secrets  Show secrets in plaintext instead of hiding them.
  --exit-zero     Always return a 0 (non-error) status code, even if issues
                  are found.The env var GITGUARDIAN_EXIT_ZERO can also be used
                  to set this option.

  --all-policies  Present fails of all policies (Filenames, FileExtensions,
                  Secret Detection). By default, only Secret Detection is
                  shown.

  -h, --help      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  ci            scan in a CI environment.
  commit-range  scan a defined COMMIT_RANGE in git.
  path          scan files and directories.
  pre-commit    scan as a pre-commit git hook.
  repo          clone and scan a REPOSITORY.
```

`ggshield scan` has different subcommands for each type of scan:

- `CI`: scan each commit since the last build in your CI.

  `ggshield scan ci`

  No options or arguments

- `Commit Range`: scan each commit in the given commit range

  ```
  Usage: ggshield scan commit-range [OPTIONS] COMMIT_RANGE

    scan a defined COMMIT_RANGE in git.

    git rev-list COMMIT_RANGE to list several commits to scan. example:
    ggshield scan commit-range HEAD~1...
  ```

- `Path`: scan files or directories with the recursive option.

  ```
  Usage: ggshield scan path [OPTIONS] PATHS...

    scan files and directories.

  Options:
    -r, --recursive  Scan directory recursively
    -y, --yes        Confirm recursive scan
    -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
  ```

- `Pre-commit`: scan every changes that have been staged in a git repository.

  `ggshield scan pre-commit`

  No options or arguments

- `Repo`: scan all commits in a git repository.

  ```
  Usage: ggshield scan repo [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY

    scan a REPOSITORY at a given URL or path

    REPOSITORY is the clone URI or the path of the repository to scan.
    Examples:

    ggshield scan repo git@github.com:GitGuardian/gg-shield.git

    ggshield scan repo /repositories/gg-shield
  ```

## Install command

The `install` command allows you to use ggshield as a pre-commit hook on your machine, either locally or globally for all repositories.

You will find further details in the pre-commit part of this documentation.

```shell
Usage: ggshield install [OPTIONS]

  Command to install a pre-commit hook (local or global).

Options:
  -m, --mode [local|global]  Hook installation mode  [required]
  -f, --force                Force override
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
```

# Configuration

Configuration in `ggshield` follows a `global>local>CLI` configuration scheme.

Meaning options on `local` overwrite or extend `global` and options on CLI overwrite or extend local.

`ggshield` will search for a `global` config file in the user's home directory (example: `~/.gitguardian.yml` on Linux and `%USERPROFILE%\.gitguardian` on Windows).

`ggshield` will recognize as well a `local` config file in the user's working directory (example: `./.gitguardian.yml`).

You can also use the option `--config-path` on the main command to set another config file. In this case, neither `local` nor `global` config files will be evaluated (example: `ggshield --config-path=~/Desktop/only_config.yaml scan path -r .`)

A sample config file can be found at [.gitguardian.example](./.gitguardian.example.yml)

```yml
# Exclude files and paths by globbing
paths-ignore:
  - '**/README.md'
  - 'doc/*'
  - 'LICENSE'

# Ignore policy breaks with the SHA256 of the policy break obtained at output or the secret itself
matches-ignore:
  - 530e5a4a7ea00814db8845dd0cae5efaa4b974a3ce1c76d0384ba715248a5dc1
  - MY_TEST_CREDENTIAL

show-secrets: false # default: false

# Set to true if the desired exit code for the CLI is always 0,
# otherwise the exit code will be 1 if issues are found.
# the environment variable GITGUARDIAN_EXIT_ZERO=true can also be used toggle this behaviour.
exit-zero: false # default: false

# By default only secrets are detected. Use all-policies to toggle this behaviour.
all-policies: false # default: false

api-url: https://api.gitguardian.com # GITGUARDIAN_API_URL environment variable will override this setting

verbose: false # default: false
```

## Environment Variables

Some configurations on `ggshield` can be done through environment variables.

Environment variables will override settings set on your config file but will be overridden by command line options.

At startup, `ggshield` will attempt to load environment variables from different environment files in the following order:

- path pointed to by the environment variable `GITGUARDIAN_DOTENV_PATH`
- `.env` at your current work directory.
- `.env` at the root of the current git directory

Only one file will be loaded of the three.

Reference of current Environment Variables that affect `ggshield`:

```yaml
GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY: [Required] API Key for the GitGuardian API.

GITGUARDIAN_API_URL: Custom URL for the scanning API.

GITGUARDIAN_DONT_LOAD_ENV: If set to any value environment variables won't be loaded from a file.

GITGUARDIAN_DOTENV_PATH: If set to a path, `ggshield` will attempt to load the environment from the specified file.
```

## On-premises configuration

GitGuardian shield can be configured to run on your on-premises dashboard, request an API key from your dashboard administrator.

You can modify your environment variables to include:

```shell
GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY=<GitGuardian API Key>
GITGUARDIAN_API_URL=<GitGuardian on-premises API URL>
```

Alternatively to setting the `GITGUARDIAN_API_URL` environment variable, set the `api-url` in your `.gitguardian.yaml`.

# Pre-commit

## The pre-commit framework

In order to use **ggshield** with the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework, you need to do the following steps.

Make sure you have pre-commit installed:

```shell
$ pip install pre-commit
```

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your root repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/gitguardian/gg-shield
    rev: main
    hooks:
      - id: ggshield
        language_version: python3
        stages: [commit]
```

Then install the hook with the command:

```shell
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now you're good to go!

If you want to skip the pre-commit check, you can add `-n` parameter:

```shell
$ git commit -m "commit message" -n
```

Another way is to add SKIP=hook_id before the command:

```shell
$ SKIP=ggshield git commit -m "commit message"
```

## The global and local pre-commit hook

To install pre-commit globally (for all current and future repos), you just need to execute the following command:

```shell
$ ggshield install --mode global
```

It will do the following:

- check if a global hook folder is defined in the global git configuration
- create the `~/.git/hooks` folder (if needed)
- create a `pre-commit` file which will be executed before every commit
- give executable access to this file

You can also install the hook locally on desired repositories.
You just need to go in the repository and execute:

```shell
$ ggshield install --mode local
```

If a pre-commit executable file already exists, it will not be overridden.

You can force override with the `--force` option:

```shell
$ ggshield install --mode local --force
```

If you already have a pre-commit executable file and you want to use gg-shield,
all you need to do is to add this line in the file:

```shell
$ ggshield scan pre-commit
```

If you want to try pre-commit scanning through the docker image:

```shell
$ docker run -e GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY -v $(pwd):/data --rm gitguardian/ggshield ggshield scan pre-commit
```

Do not forget to add your [GitGuardian API Key](https://dashboard.gitguardian.com/api/v1/auth/user/github_login/authorize?utm_source=github&utm_medium=gg_shield&utm_campaign=shield1) to the `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` environment variable of your project or development environment.

# Git pre-receive hooks

A pre-receive hook allows you to reject commits from being pushed to a git repository if they do not validate every check.

You can find **gg-shield**'s pre-receive hook samples in the [doc/pre-receive.sample](doc/pre-receive.sample) and [doc/pre-receive-python.sample](doc/pre-receive-python.sample).

### Python git pre-receive hook

> ⚠ this pre-receive hook requires the host machine to have python>=3.6 and pip installed

[**pre-receive-python.sample**](doc/pre-receive-python.sample)

- Install ggshield from pip: `pip install ggshield`
- Move `pre-receive-python.sample` to `.git/hooks/pre-receive`
- Do not forget to `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-receive`
- either set an environment variable machine wide `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` or set it in the `.git/hooks/pre-receive` as instructed in the sample file.

**How do I add ignored matches and use a custom config in this pre-receive hook?**

- Create a `gitguardian.yaml` somewhere in the system. An example config file is available [here](.gitguardian.example.yml)
- Replace in the pre-receive hook
  ```shell
  ggshield scan commit-range "${span}" && continue
  ```
  with:
  ```shell
  ggshield -c <INSERT path to gitguardian.yaml> scan commit-range "${span}" && continue
  ```

### Docker git pre-receive hook

> ⚠ this pre-receive hook requires the host machine to have docker installed.

[**pre-receive.sample**](doc/pre-receive.sample)

- Move `pre-receive.sample` to `.git/hooks/pre-receive`
- Do not forget to `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-receive`
- either set an environment variable machine wide `GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` or set it in the `.git/hooks/pre-receive` as instructed in the sample file.

**How do I add ignored matches and use a custom config in this pre-receive hook?**

- Create a `gitguardian.yaml` somewhere in the system. An example config file is available [here](.gitguardian.example.yml)
- Replace in the pre-receive hook
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data -e GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY gitguardian/ggshield:latest ggshield scan commit-range "${span}" && continue
  ```
  with:
  ```shell
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data -v <INSERT path of gitguardian.yaml directory>:/config -e GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY gitguardian/ggshield:latest ggshield -c /config/gitguardian.yaml scan commit-range "${span}" && continue
  ```

# Output

If no secrets or policy breaks have been found, the exit code will be 0:

```bash
$ ggshield scan pre-commit
```

If a secret or other issue is found in your staged code or in your CI,
you will have an alert giving you the type of policy break,
the filename where the policy break has been found and a patch
giving you the position of the policy break in the file:

```shell
$ ggshield scan pre-commit

🛡️  ⚔️  🛡️  2 policy breaks have been found in file production.rb
