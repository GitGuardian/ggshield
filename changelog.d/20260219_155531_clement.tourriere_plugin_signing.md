### Added

- Add sigstore signature verification for plugin wheels, enforcing identity-based trust via OIDC. Plugins can be verified in STRICT, WARN, or DISABLED mode, configurable through enterprise settings or the `--allow-unsigned` flag.

### Fixed

- Forward `signature_mode` through GitHub release and GitHub artifact download paths, ensuring signature verification is applied consistently across all install sources.
