### Added

- New command `ggshield iac scan all` that replaces the now-deprecated `ggshield iac scan`. It allows to scan for vulnerabilities in an IaC directory.

- New command `ggshield iac scan diff`. This scans a Git repository and inspects changes in IaC vulnerabilities between two points in the history.
  - All options from `ggshield iac scan all` are supported: `--ignore-policy`, `--minimum-severity`, `--ignore-path` etc. Execute `ggshield iac scan diff -h` for more details.
  - Two new options allow to choose which state to select for the difference: `--ref <GIT-REFERENCE>` and `--staged`.
  - Some options facilitate the use of the command in CI/CD: `--pre-commit`, `--pre-push`, `--pre-receive`
  - The command output will list vulnerabilities as `unchanged`, `new` and `deleted`

### Deprecated

- `ggshield iac scan` is now replaced by the new `ggshield iac scan all`, which supports the same options and arguments.
