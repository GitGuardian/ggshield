### Added

- `hmsl`: Secrets shorter than 6 characters are now filtered out before being sent to the HMSL API, reducing false positives from obvious non-secrets.

### Changed

- `hmsl`: Expanded the list of excluded placeholder values (e.g., `changeme`, `placeholder`, `redacted`) that are not sent to the HMSL API.
